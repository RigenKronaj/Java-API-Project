# Java-API-Project
Project in Java to implement an API

--------------------------------------------------------

Resolved previous issues, code now works as intended

Documentation has been updated, everything should be complete

As a side note, for some reason rebuilding the maven package seems to have introduced a lot of files that were previously not there.
The project works with or without them but I decided to leave them there in case they were somehow important.

Worked on by: Rigen Kronaj, Nikaela Kronaj
