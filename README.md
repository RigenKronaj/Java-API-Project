# Java-API-Project
Partially completed project in Java to implement an API

--------------------------------------------------------

So far we have managed to partially implement an API call to retrieve all articles in the store that have a lower stock than minimum
however currently the request only returns one product (this is not the intended result)

The code either needs to be improved or an unknown bug has to be fixed
